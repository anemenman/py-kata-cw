Input
Input will consist of a list of pairs. Each pair contains information for a single potential member. Information
consists of an integer for the person's age and an integer for the person's handicap.

Output
Output will consist of a list of string values (in Haskell and C: Open or Senior) stating whether the respective member
is to be placed in the senior or open category.

Example
input =  [[18, 20], [45, 2], [61, 12], [37, 6], [21, 21], [78, 9]]
output = ["Open", "Open", "Senior", "Open", "Open", "Senior"]
